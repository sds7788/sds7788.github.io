#### Biography

My name is Desong Sui. I am currently a sophomore student majoring in Data Science at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at USTC(the University of Science and Technology of China).

I am focused on advancing Large Language Models, with a particular emphasis on efficient inference, post-training strategies (such as Reinforcement Learning), and multimodal models.

#### Research Interests

My current research interests are in pre-training and post-training in LMMs and evaluation of MLLMs capabilities .

Recently, I am working on my own independent attempt to fully train a language model (planned parameter volume is about 1B), trying the whole process of data side synthesis filtering, infra barrel, pre-training, and post-training.
